## Jupyter Notebook Files

These files were used for various purposes, and have brief descriptions below.

### BenchmarkGPT

The notebook version of benchmark_gpt.py. It is recommended to use the python script if possible, as it can be run to completion more easily, as whatever computer runs the file needs to remain on and connected to the internet for the duration.

### ChatGPT_API_Wrapper

A file that lets you interact with the ChatGPT web interface through python code. Should not be used to automate requests, as it may result in OpenAI taking action against the account.

### MineWikiArticles

The file used to extract some wikipedia articles for use with GPT 4 later. Was used to help inform the creation of WikiGPTTriplesGeneration.

### PropertyHistograms

Used to extract all properties used within a dataset and display them in a histogram. As there are many unique properties in our data, this is required to be in a Jupyter Notebook to see the entire histogram.

### WikiGPTTriplesGeneration

The file used to extract specific categories of wikipedia artices, and then generate triples for a subset of them using GPT4.
