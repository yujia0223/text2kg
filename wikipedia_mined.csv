"Bradford House II (Site 5JF51) is a prehistoric rockshelter,  24 kilometres (15 mi) southwest of Denver. It is situated on land owned by the Ken-Caryl Ranch Master Association. It was excavated in the summer and fall of 1973 by the Denver Chapter of the Colorado Archaeological Society. The excavations found several cultural features and recovered thousands of chipped stone artifacts, dozens of ground stone artifacts, a few ceramic sherds, bone tools, and faunal remains. The site was used by prehistoric groups during the Middle and Late Archaic periods, as well as the Early Woodland, and Middle Woodland periods. This is a span of 4,500 years.
Bradford House II is located in the Ken-Caryl Valley. The Front Range foothills to the west and the Lyons and Dakota hogbacks to the east frame the valley. An abundance of archaeological sites, attests to the valley's attraction for the earliest inhabitants of the area. They frequented the area for its abundant resources, including shelter under the many bedrock monoliths scattered across the valley, lithic materials for chipped stone tools, and edible plants and animals.
West of the valley, the arkosic sandstones of the Pennsylvanian Fountain formation lie unconformably upon uplifted Precambrian metamorphic rocks of the Front Range (Rathbun 1997:21) . Although mostly covered by recent to pre-Wisconsin alluvium, the Fountain formation forms southwest facing escarpments, or monoliths, with undercut shelters or caves (Rathbun 1997:21), many of which were inhabited by prehistoric peoples. The elevation of the site is approximately 1878 m (6160 ft.) above mean sea level. Elevations surrounding the site range from about 1828 m (6000 ft.) in the Dutch Creek water gap to 1992 m (6536 ft.) on the highest point of the Dakota hogback ridge.
The valley has a sunny, mild, and semiarid climate that has neither the extreme cold of the higher elevations to the west nor the hot summer afternoons of the eastern plains (Tate 1997:15). A south-facing rock shelter like Bradford House II absorbs a great deal of solar radiation, further mitigating the winter cold. Precipitation is moderate, averaging 15 to 18 inches, and winter snows melt quickly (Tate 1997:17) with frequent down slope (chinook) winds.
The valley consists of various grasses and forbs. The surrounding hogbacks and foothills support a pine-Douglas fir vegetation community. The recovery of floral materials from Bradford House II and other archaeological sites in the valley (Johnson 1997:Table Gl) indicates that local plants such as sunflower, wild plum, acorn, and chokecherry were gathered and used by prehistoric peoples. Many animals, including elk, mule deer, and occasional Big Horn sheep, as well as a variety of carnivores, rabbits, rodents, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish are found in the hogbacks and foothills. Unworked animal, mostly mammal, bone was found in abundance in the Archaic and Early Ceramic levels (Johnson and Lyons 1997a:49, Table 6). Mule deer dominates the assemblage, followed by elk, bison, and rabbit, with little change in dietary preferences from the earlier to later time periods. Several bone tools (awls, beads, reamers, bone scrapers, and bone drills) and antler flakers were recovered from all cultural levels in the site (Johnson and Lyons 1997a) ."
"Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge is located in the U.S. state of North Dakota. The majority of the land area of the refuge has been designated as wilderness and is known as the Chase Lake Wilderness. The refuge is one of the oldest in the U.S., having been set aside in 1908. The refuge has more breeding pairs of white pelicans than any other protected area in the U.S. Chase Lake NWR is managed through Arrowwwood National Wildlife Refuge Complex and in turn, a number of other refuges and wetland management districts are managed from Chase Lake including:

Chase Lake WMD
Chase Lake Prairie Project
Valley City WMD
Tomahawk NWR
Stoney Slough NWR
Sibley Lake NWR
Halfway Lake NWR
Hobart Lake NWRHome to as many as 30,000 white pelicans, the wilderness preserves habitat for the largest single grouping of pelicans in North America. The pelicans have enjoyed a tremendous rebound from the 50 or so examples that existed in the region when first counted in 1908. Tending to nest on two large islands within the lake for protection from predators, some of the pelicans have been banded and these same birds have been found as far south as the Everglades in Florida during the winter months. Chase Lake is an alkaline lake and supports no fish species, so the pelicans rely on the plentiful tiger salamander as a food source. The white pelican is the largest of all pelicans; they can have a 10-foot (3.0 m) wingspan and weigh an average of 20 pounds.
Many other bird species can also be found here including herons, loons, ibises, ducks, geese, hawks and terns to name but a few. White-tailed deer, weasels, coyote and badger also inhabit the refuge."

"The 2011 Foxtel Cup was the inaugural season of the Australian rules football club knockout cup competition involving clubs from the various state league competitions from around Australia. The first year of the competition also included the AFL's newest expansion side Greater Western Sydney Giants.
Its purpose was to support and promote the second-tier Australian rules football competitions and to provide another way of developing the lower-tier AFL players. It was originally designed to be a one-off, but due to a significant amount of public interest the AFL said the competition would continue for at least the next five years.The competition began on 26 March 2011 and ran through to August. Matches were played as curtain-raisers to AFL Saturday night games and were screened on Fox Sports in a late-afternoon slot between afternoon and night AFL matches. $40,000 of prize money was awarded to eventual winners, Williamstown Football Club.The AFL originally invited the three highest ranked teams from the South Australian National Football League, the Victorian Football League and the West Australian Football League; the top two teams from the Queensland Australian Football League; and the top team from AFL Sydney and the Tasmanian Football League. The Northern Territory Football Club and Greater Western Sydney Giants received special invitations.However, despite the SANFL on 9 December 2010 signing on to be part of the Cup competition, opposition to the proposal came from its top three clubs Central District, Norwood and Woodville-West Torrens. The three clubs were given until 14 December 2010 to reconsider with the SANFL willing to extend invitations to its next best teams from 2010 if its top three clubs refused to participate. After the top five SANFL clubs released a joint statement on 15 December 2010 declining the invitation to participate in the Cup competition, citing lack of prize money, sponsorship conflicts, salary cap implications, schedule concerns and removing the focus from their SANFL premiership ambitions, their places were taken up by fellow SANFL clubs West Adelaide, North Adelaide and Port Adelaide Magpies.The AFL gave the Cup competition the go ahead on 17 December 2010 with the fixture released publicly. The official name of the tournament (Foxtel Cup), finalised fixture and participating teams were formalised on 9 February 2011 by the AFL.
Williamstown became the inaugural Foxtel Cup champions when they defeated Claremont by 21 points in the Grand Final at Patersons Stadium on 6 August 2011. Williamstown midfielder Ben Jolley won the Coles Medal as best afield for his game-high 30 possessions and eight clearances."

"A digital print matrix is the digital state from which a print art object can be instanced with original intent.
The traditional term  print matrix is the physical surface from which an image is printed, woodblock, plate, stone or screen. Although these may in themselves be produced digitally they comprise a traditional (physical) matrix. A digital matrix however is a repository of material which, stored digitally, is combined by the artist's hand and instanced with original intent; Philip George's “fluid diary” providing an early example. Technically the digital matrix comprises stable digital storage mechanisms (which retain the data when switched off) rather than volatile random access memory. Conceptually as there is no need for this storage to be in the physical presence of the artist then online and remote storage (including the Internet) may form as a whole or in part the digital matrix."

"The family of Gediminas is a group of family members of Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania (ca. 1275–1341), who interacted in the 14th century. The family included the siblings, children, and grandchildren of the Grand Duke and played the pivotal role in the history of Lithuania for the period as the Lithuanian nobility had not yet acquired its influence. Gediminas was also the forefather of the Gediminid dynasty, which ruled the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from 1310s or 1280s to 1572.
Gediminas' origins are unclear, but recent research suggests that Skalmantas, an otherwise unknown historical figure, was Gediminas' grandfather or father and could be considered the dynasty's founder. Because none of his brothers or sisters had known heirs, Gediminas, who sired at least twelve children, had the advantage in establishing sovereignty over his siblings. Known for his diplomatic skills, Gediminas arranged his children's marriages to suit the goals of his foreign policy: his sons consolidated Lithuanian power within the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, while his daughters established or strengthened alliances with the rulers of areas in modern-day Russia, Ukraine and Poland.The relationships among Gediminas' children were generally harmonious, with the notable exception of Jaunutis, who was deposed in 1345 by his brothers Algirdas and Kęstutis. These two brothers went on to provide a celebrated example of peaceful power-sharing. However, Gediminas' many grandchildren and their descendants engaged in power struggles that continued well into the 15th century. Gediminas' grandchildren converted Lithuania to Christianity and inaugurated the first personal union with Poland."

"Aztec warfare concerns the aspects associated with the militaristic conventions, forces, weaponry and strategic expansions conducted by the Late Postclassic Aztec civilizations of Mesoamerica, including particularly the military history of the Aztec Triple Alliance involving the city-states of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, Tlacopan and other allied polities of the central Mexican region.
The Aztec armed forces were typically composed of a large number of commoners (yāōquīzqueh [jaː.oːˈkiːskeʔ], ""those who have gone to war"") who possessed only basic military training, and a smaller but still considerable number of professional warriors belonging to the nobility (pīpiltin [piːˈpiɬtin]) and who were organized into warrior societies and ranked according to their achievements. The Aztec state was in the center on political expansion and dominance of and exaction of tribute from other city states, and warfare was the basic dynamic force in Aztec politics. Aztec society was also centered on warfare: every Aztec male received basic military training from an early age and one of the few possible opportunities of upwards social mobility for commoners (mācehualtin [maːseˈwaɬtin]) was through military achievement — especially the taking of captives (māltin [ˈmaːɬtin], singular malli). Thus, only specifically chosen men served in the military. The sacrifice of war captives was a very important part of many of the Aztec religious festivals.

"The Federal Act on the Reduction of CO2 Emissions (CO2 Act) (German: CO2-Gesetz, French: Loi sur le CO2, Italian: Legge sul CO2), is a Swiss federal law that regulates carbon dioxide emissions to mitigate climate change.The CO2 Act is at the core of Switzerland's climate political measures. One of the key measures is the introduction of a carbon tax, to disincentivize greenhouse gas emissions. Part of the levy is used for climate protection, and the remaining amounts are redistributed to the population and business community in proportion to their original payment (art. 36). Another pillar of the tax is the introduction of an emissions trading scheme.
The law is based on articles 74 and 89 of the Swiss Constitution. According to these, the Confederation shall ""legislate on the protection of the population and its natural environment against damage or nuisance"" (art. 74) and ""on the use of energy by installations, vehicles and appliances"" (art. 89).From 2023, the CO2 Act is supplemented by the Act on Climate Protection Targets, Innovation and Strengthening Energy Security. It sets the objective for Switzerland to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050."

"Coptic (Bohairic Coptic: ϯⲙⲉⲧⲣⲉⲙⲛ̀ⲭⲏⲙⲓ, timetremǹnkhēmi) is an Egyptian language family of closely related dialects, representing the most recent developments of the Egyptian language, and historically spoken by the Copts, starting from the third century AD in Roman Egypt. Coptic was supplanted by Arabic as the primary spoken language of Egypt following the Muslim conquest of Egypt and was slowly replaced over the centuries. Coptic has no native speakers today, although it remains in daily use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church and of the Coptic Catholic Church. Innovations in grammar, phonology, and the influx of Greek loanwords distinguish Coptic from earlier periods of the Egyptian language. It is written with the Coptic alphabet, a modified form of the Greek alphabet with several additional letters borrowed from the Demotic Egyptian script.The major Coptic dialects are Sahidic, Bohairic, Akhmimic, Fayyumic, Lycopolitan, and Oxyrhynchite. Sahidic Coptic was spoken between the cities of Asyut and Oxyrhynchus and flourished as a literary language across Egypt in the period c. 325 – c. 800 AD. Bohairic, the language of the Nile Delta, gained prominence in the 9th century and is the dialect used by the Coptic Church. Despite being closely related, Coptic dialects differ from one another in terms of their phonology, morphology, and vocabulary."

"Colin Teague (c. 1780—1839) was a missionary and part of the American Colonization Society's settlement efforts in Africa. He was a member of the First Baptist Church in Richmond, Virginia.
Born a slave, he eventually bought his freedom and worked as a saddlemaker. He was recruited along with Lott Cary to establish a colony on the west African coast for resettlement of the growing population of freed slaves in the U.S. A missionary, he worked to establish a Baptist church in the colony of Liberia and to recruit native inhabitants. His son Hilary Teague became a prominent pastor, businessman, newspaper editor, and political leader in Liberia.Efforts to establish a colony in Liberia proved difficult. Indigenous people refused to work for the colonists and securing building supplies was rough in the hot and buggy climate. Teague reportedly expressed an interest in abandoning the effort.He was married to Frances Teage. The family emigrated to West Africa in 1821 to help establish the colony of former slaves and other African Americans with support from the U.S. government, Christian organizations and slaveholders. The effort was criticized by other groups including many free Blacks."
"Cor!!, a British comic book, was launched in June 1970 by IPC (International Publishing Corporation), their sixth new comic in just over a year. Cor!! was edited by Bob Paynter.
The comic had 32 pages and included full-colour front and back pages and centre spread.  It depicted traditional British characters, albeit with a slight tweak.  The unruly schoolkids of The Gaswork Gang echoed The Bash Street Kids of The Beano, Tomboy was firmly in the Minnie the Minx vein, whilst Tricky Dicky seemed like a version of Roger the Dodger, albeit with longer hair and shorter trousers.
The first Cor!! featured Gus Gorilla on the front cover, drawn by Mike Lacey. The strip was in the shape of a glass, to promote the free fruit drink that came with this issue. The comic's most popular strip was Ivor Lott and Tony Broke, a classic tale of two boys – one rich, one poor, with the latter usually the victor of the many battles they had.  The strip continued long after the comic closed, finally ending in the last edition of Buster in January 2000.
Another popular strip, Whacky, debuted in the first edition, initially in a half-page format, sharing space with readers' letters.  The strip later added the tagline ""He’s always getting whacked"" to emphasize the story of a schoolboy who is regularly caned by his sadistic teacher – the equally appropriately named Mr. Thwackery.
The first line-up changes occurred in the 1970 ""Bonfire"" issue when five new features debuted. 1972 saw three newcomers in the New Year issue, including Victorian miser Jasper the Grasper and Frankie Stein – Teenage Werewolf. One notable later strip featured the BBC comedians The Goodies.  Drawn by Joe Colquhoun, the double-page feature lasted the whole of 1973.
Four years and 210 issues later the comic was eventually merged with Buster in June 1974, symptomatic of the diminishing market for British comics - though several further titles were launched by IPC and other publishers during the next few years. The long-running Lion and Scorcher also disappeared in 1974. The Cor!! name was kept alive by summer specials and annuals, finally ending in 1986."

"The  First Presbyterian Church at Locust and 1st Street, East in Lapwai, Idaho is a historic Presbyterian church built in 1909.  It was added to the National Register in 1980.
Its importance was described in its NRHP nomination:The Lapwai First Presbyterian Church is architecturally and historically significant as a design of the well-known Lewiston architect J. H. Nave and as an important architectural symbol of organized Christianity in this Nez Perce Indian town. It is perhaps the best early building extant in present-day Lapwai. It is certainly the only early building in the town to substantially retain not only its original form but its original use, as Presbyterian services are still held there. It is a fine example of the efforts of a small congregation to house itself in a modest but stylish structure.
There was a Presbyterian mission active on the Nez Perce reservation active for a while before the Lapwai congregation was established in 1907.  The architect, Nave, and contractor, James Milton, were selected by Indian Agent J.N. Alley in 1909.  The church was built for $2,600, with some funds from citizens of Lapwai and neighborhing Sweetwater, Idaho, and with $800 from the Presbyterian Board of Building Erection in New York."

"Diogo of Portugal (1425–1443) was a Portuguese royal prince, who briefly served as Constable of Portugal and Master of the Order of Santiago.
Diogo was the eldest son of John, Lord of Reguengos de Monsaraz, Infante of Portugal, and of his wife (and niece) Isabella of Barcelos. Through his father, Diogo was the grandson of King John I of Portugal and through his mother, the grandson of Afonso of Barcelos (future first duke of Braganza).
John of Reguengos had been the master of the Order of Santiago since 1418 and Constable of Portugal since 1431.  Upon John's premature death in October 1442, the Portuguese regent, Peter of Coimbra decided to appoint John's son Diogo as the new Constable of Portugal.  Diogo was elected on 24 January 1443, as 11th Master of the Order of Santiago.  Diogo died a few days later, without issue.  Peter appointed his own son, also named Peter, to succeed him as constable.
These appointments were contested by Diogo's half-uncle (and grandfather), Afonso, Count of Barcelos. Afonso had married the daughter of the late beatified constable Nuno Álvares Pereira, and believed their son,  Afonso of Ourem, had superior rights to succeed as Constable of Portugal. Peter of Coimbra challenged Barcelos and Ourem to provide documentary proof of the legitimacy of this lineage (which they were unable to produce).  Peter of Coimbra attempted to mollify them by creating the title of Duke of Braganza, and investing it in Afonso of Barcelos.  However, this failed to heal the breach between Peter and Afonso, which would only grow with time."

"The Fock space is an algebraic construction used in quantum mechanics to construct the quantum states space of a variable or unknown number of identical particles from a single particle Hilbert space H. It is named after V. A. Fock who first introduced it in his 1932 paper ""Konfigurationsraum und zweite Quantelung"" (""Configuration space and second quantization"").Informally, a Fock space is the sum of a set of Hilbert spaces representing zero particle states, one particle states, two particle states, and so on. If the identical particles are bosons, the n-particle states are vectors in a symmetrized tensor product of n single-particle Hilbert spaces H. If the identical particles are fermions, the n-particle states are vectors in an antisymmetrized tensor product of n single-particle Hilbert spaces H (see symmetric algebra and exterior algebra respectively). A general state in Fock space is a linear combination of n-particle states, one for each n.
Technically, the Fock space is (the Hilbert space completion of) the direct sum of the symmetric or antisymmetric tensors in the tensor powers of a single-particle Hilbert space H,
